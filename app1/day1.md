## What is a bug?
Programmers spend around 20-40% of their time coding and 20-40% hunting and fixing bugs. Take a look at the program below:

``print("Hello"``

That program has a bug because when you run the program, it produces an error message. THe error message in our case is this:

```
print("Hello"

SyntaxError: '(' was never closed
```

### How to fix a bug

As a programmer, you should carefully read the error message and try to understand it. In our particular example, the error message informs us that we forgot a parenthesis. Therefore, to fix the bug, you should add a parenthesis as follows:

``print("Hello")``

Run the above code, and you will see that it returns the expected output, which is *Hello*. That means the bug has been fixed.
