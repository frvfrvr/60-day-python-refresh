# day 5

- Enumerated Lists
- f-strings
- list.clear() and .pop()
- len() function
- Googling, searching for function in a programming language is ok
- Asking a programming question is ok. Remember to provide code and what error occured and expected output so others can see, reproduce the error and give a solution.


- `.clear()` - clears the list
- `.pop()` - pop one item on the list
- `len()` - shows the length of the list, string, etc.
- `enumerate()` - adds enumeration to the list, technically prints each item as a tuple of indice and item.
