# day 4

- Editing a todo list on the fly
- List indexing
- specifying type in input
- importance of types
- tuples



```python
mylist = ['a', 'b', 'c']
z = mylist(1) # string type
```

There are scenarios that string in variable is not changed. Strings are not mutable by default.

Tuple is immutable version of the list.
